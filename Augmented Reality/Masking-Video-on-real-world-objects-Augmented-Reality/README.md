### Project your video on any physical object using power of Python


- In this Computer Vision project we have used **ARUco Markers** backed by **OpenCV** to augment any video on any physical object . 

- The OpenCV tracks the ARUco markers present in the input frame &#8594; Mark the bounding frame around it &#8594; Augments the provided video frame by frame on that bounding box.

- This overall process is made possible using advanced image processing techniques like Homography and Image Masking. 

- This tracking & masking is done in real-time, so as a rendered product it seems that there is no ARUco marker. Instead there is a video running itself. Please have a look at the working demo in below section.

 ## Installation & Implementation

1.  Clone the repository on your system
    
    `git clone https://github.com/tirth-2001/Meditech-Healthcare.git`
    
2.  Or direct download ZIP file in your system
3. For running the project, first make a paper which has respective ARUco Markers pasted on it. Take reference from the video shown in the demo section above.
4. Go to the project folder in which `AR_Video.py` file is present. Open it , and check the relative path for reference marker, input video, masking video etc.
5. For running the code, install the dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
6. Finally, if everything is ready and installed, execute the `AR_Video.py` file and you will see the window which shows the augmented video on your ARUco frame.
