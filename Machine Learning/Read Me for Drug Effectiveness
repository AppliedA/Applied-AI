The Drug Data Set is trained using Decision Tree Classifier using the Data Set hosted by IBM.

This data set has been cleaned by me on IBM Watson as a result I can not push that into private git repo hence the Cleaned Data Set is hosted on IBM Server and then the ML model training has been done

This dataset requires a little bit of pre-processing left which is done on the runtime in the Notebook Attached.

As we expect our test results from the user we shall train the model with the complete data set available. 
It has shown accuracy of 98.33% which is Great.

It Requires 5 Attributes  : 
1. Age  : A float number expected
2. Sex  : 0 - Female 1 - Male
3. BP   : 0 - High 1 - Low 2 - Normal
4. Cholestrol : 0 - High 1 - Normal
5 Na to K ratio in Blood : A float number expected

Also needs A true value for the Test Set if possible to testify the results.
Nevertheless the Model will predict according to the Data Set available.
