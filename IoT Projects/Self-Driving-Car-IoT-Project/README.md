### Build your own Small Tesla : Driverless Car

- Back in 2016, I have developed a wired remote controlled car. Then using **Raspberry Pi** and a mobile app, I converted it to a wireless car which can be operated using app.

- After taking inspiration from Tesla, now I have transformed my that car into driverless **Self Driving Car**.

- Whenever any obstacle will be detected by **Ultrasonic Sensor**, the car will sense it and will take a turn for moving on a safe path. For more clear idea, see the video below.
